<H3>Welcome</H3>
<p>Welcome to your first assembly lesson. I suggest you to read the <a href="../lowlevel.html">preliminary
lesson</a> before proceeding. If you have read it, I understand that everything
is not clear. Now, I try to clarify things here. I also assume that you have the
tools you need: an assembler and a text editor. If you don't have either TASM or
MASM, you can look at free assemblers <a href="../mylink.html">in here</a>. Of
course you'd have to adjust your code a bit. I assume that you are able convert
numbers from decimal to binary or to hexadecimal and vice versa. You would
probably need a Norton Guide for assembly language. It acts like a help when you
forget any commands or &quot;magic numbers&quot;.
<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Why Assembly?</h3>
<p>Some of you may complain about assembly: It's difficult, error prone, hard to
debug, takes a lot of time to develop, etc. Yes, that's true. However:
<ol>
  <li>Assembly is <b><u>fast</u></b>. A LOT faster than any compiler of any
    language could ever produce.</li>
  <li>Assembly is a lot closer to machine level than any language because the
    commands of assembly language is mapped 1-1 to machine instructions.</li>
  <li>Assembly code is <b><u>A LOT smaller</u></b> than any compiler of any
    language could ever produce.</li>
  <li>In Assembly, you have the <b>RAW power</b> of your machine. You can tweak
    it any way you want.</li>
  <li>In Assembly, we can do <b>a lot of things</b> that we can't do in any
    higher level language, such as playing with processor flags, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>'Nuff said. You must have a really good reason in writing assembly language.
Don't do anything in assembly. Instead, tweak any codes that need speed or size
smashed into assembly. Otherwise you'd end up with unfinished projects.
<p>&nbsp;
<h3>COM Structure</h3>
<p>Among the simplest structure of assembly language is COM structure. The
structure is quite straight forward to implement. However, there are some
restrictions apply:
<ul>
  <li>Code and data must be contained within 64KB limit (there is a work around
    for this, but that's another story).</li>
  <li>Cannot reserve memory through operating system (there is a work around for
    this, too).</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, don't bother about the 64KB restriction. It is a whole lot of code and
data -- for now. Trust me! Probably after you code some assembly language, you'd
understand why Bill Gates said that 1 MB is <b>THE</b> unreachable limits years
ago :-).<p>OK, let's look into our first program (TASM ideal version):
<hr><pre>ideal
p286n
model tiny

codeseg
   org 100h
   jmp start

   ; your data and subroutine here

start:
   mov ax, 4c00h
   int 21h
end</pre><hr>
<p>In MASM version:
<hr><pre>.286
.model tiny

.code
   org 100h
entry:
   jmp start

   ; your data and subroutine here

start:
   mov ax, 4c00h
   int 21h
end entry</pre><hr>
<p>It's pretty much similar. Let's save your file into <TT>MYPROG.ASM</TT>
<p>To assemble it using TASM, type the following:
<pre>tasm myprog
tlink /t myprog</pre>
<p>For MASM, type: <TT>ML myprog.asm</TT>
<p>Here is line-by-line explanation on the program:
<ul>
  <li><TT>ideal</TT> says that we're using ideal syntax of TASM.</li>
  <li><TT>p286n</TT> or <TT>.286</TT> says that we're using 80286 processor instructions.
    Here, we still use 8088 assembly language, so the result is runnable in
    PC/XT.</li>
  <li><TT>model tiny</TT> or <TT>.model tiny</TT> says that we're using COM format.</li>
  <li><TT>codeseg</TT> or <TT>.code</TT> says that this is the begining of our code.</li>
  <li><TT>org 100h</TT> is the magic word you have to say for (almost) every normal COM
    programs. Don't worry about its meaning first.</li>
  <li>In MASM, we have to define an entry point while in TASM, you don't have
    to. The entry point is a label. Here we have a label called <TT>entry</TT> (marked
    with a colon <TT>:</TT>).</li>
  <li>COM programs are almost always begin with a jump, i.e. jump to the
    beginning of the code. Between the jump and the beginning of your code, you
    place your variables here. The jump is denoted by the word <TT>jmp</TT> and
    followed with a label (here we call it <TT>start</TT>).</li>
  <li>After the label <TT>start</TT>, the next two lines is just the code to
    terminate your program. <STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> Do not&nbsp;assume that
    after the end point your program terminates. You <b>have to</b> explicitly
    say that you want to quit. These two lines are used to terminate the
    program.</li>
  <li><TT>end</TT> or <tt>end entry</TT> specify the end point of your program.
    In MASM, you have to specify the entry point again after the word <TT>end</TT>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Making Labels</h3>
<p>In assembly, to make labels is simple, just put any name and stick it with a
colon(<TT>:</TT>). Label usually serves as a tag of where you'd like to jump and
so on. You have to pick <b>unique names</b> for each label, otherwise the
assembler will fail. There is a way to make it local: to prefix it with a <TT>@@</TT>
in front of the label name and still end it with a colon. However, this kind of
label only valid in procedures or sub-routines. So, don't use this kind of
labels right now.
<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>In assembly, after the word <TT>end</TT> or <TT>end entry</TT>, your program <b>DOES
NOT</b> terminate automatically. Pay attention to this. You have to specify that
you would like to terminate your program. The two line commands in above example
can be used to terminate programs.
<p>Assembly language command in x86 platform is usually formatted as follows:
<pre>[label:] mneumonic target, source</PRE>
<p>Mneumonic is just the jargon for assembly commands. Why is it called that
way? It is because that the commands in assembly (somewhat) resemble English
words. Then followed by the target, and then comma, and then the source. Label
can precede the command if any. For example:
<pre>mov ax, 4c00h</pre>
<p>Is to move the value 4c00 hexadecimal into the register AX. Simple right?
<p>If there is only one parameter (like in <TT>int 21h</TT>), usually it denotes
the source or the destination depending on the command. Like in <TT>jmp start</TT>, it
means jump to the destination <TT>start</TT>. As in <TT>int 21h</TT>,&nbsp;you
are invoking operating system library in vector 21 hexadecimal.
<p>You must notice that many of assembly language numbers are expressed in
either hexadecimal or binary. So, be really prepared.
<p>If you list the directory after you correctly assemble your program, you will
be surprised: The whole bunch of lines is squashed into <b>only 8 bytes! And
it's running!</b> WOW! See? It is still could be even smaller (5 bytes or even 2
bytes).
