<h1>Variables in Assembly</h1>
<h2><b>Variable Basics and MOV Command</b></h2>
</CENTER><BR><BR><BR>
<H3>Welcome</H3>
<p>Hi! Welcome to the second chapter of this series. This time, I'm
going to talk about the variables in Assembly. This is quite significant
since it behaves differently than that of the high programming languages
like C/C++, Pascal, or Java. I hope after following this lesson, you'll
be able to use the assembly variable context fully. Let's begin!
<p>Before starting, I just remind you that assembly language (in TASM or MASM)
is <b>NOT</b> case-sensitive. It means that "this", "This", and "tHiS" are
considered as the same. I just forgot whether I have mentioned this in the
last chapter or not. Well, you can always tell the assembly to be case-sensitive
if you'd like to. That will involves in setting some command line switches.
It will be discussed later.
<p>Moreover, I remind you that comments in assembly begins with a semicolon (;).
Everything after a semicolon until the end of the line is ignored. So, it's like
a double-slash in C++ or a quote in BASIC.
<p>I give examples in TASM ideal syntax most of the times. I assume
that you have followed the <a href="asml1001.html">previous chapter</a>
concerning the format. I don't want to specify each example in both
MASM and TASM formats since they are largely the same. The subtle
differences in MASM syntax will be mentioned.
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Variables Declaration</h3>
<p> If you recall our first program from the <a href="asml1001.html">last chapter</a>,
our ideal syntax (TASM based) looks like this:
<pre>ideal
p286n
model tiny

codeseg
   org 100h
   jmp start

   ; your data and subroutine here (this is a comment)

start:
   mov ax, 4c00h
   int 21h
end</pre>
<P>Notice where you'd put your variable declarations. It's right after the <tt>jmp
start</tt> statement. Well, you can actually place your declarations <b>anywhere</b>
inside the program. However, for now, let's just place them there. Placing it after
the <tt>start</tt> label can be disastrous if you do not handle it carefully.
<p>OK, now, there are 3 types of variable declarations in assembly that you need to
know now: <tt>db</tt>, <tt>dw</tt>, and <tt>dd</tt>. The <tt>db</tt> is to declare
the one-byte-length variables. Likewise, <tt>dw</tt> and <tt>dd</tt> are for
the word (2 bytes) variables and double-word (4 bytes) variables. Of course there
are more variable types available, but all of them deals only with numeric variables
and will be discussed later, after you grasped the core concept of assembly language.

<p>How can we declare variables then? The declaration syntax is as follows:
<pre>var_name   db   value</pre>
<p>That's simple. You need to change <tt>var_name</tt> with your variable name
and <tt>value</tt> with the corresponding default value of <tt>var_name</tt>.
Declaring word and double-word variables are just similar, you just change the
<tt>db</tt> into <tt>dw</tt> and <tt>dd</tt>. For example:

<pre>ideal
p286n
model tiny

codeseg
   org 100h
   jmp start

   <span style="background-color: #C0FFC0">score db 100</span>
   <span style="background-color: #C0FFC0">year  dw 2001</span>
   <span style="background-color: #C0FFC0">money dd 1000000</span>

start:
   mov ax, 4c00h
   int 21h
end</pre>
<P>Ah, that's straight forward. Of course you can assign those variables with
binary or hexadecimal values. Binary values would need to be appended by the
letter 'b' at the end of the number. Likewise, hexadecimals with 'h' at the
end. If the hexadecimal numbers start with letters (i.e. A, B, C, D, E, or F),
you need to add a zero in front of that number and add an 'h' after that number.
For example:
<pre>   :
   <span style="background-color: #C0FFC0">bits  db 101001b</span>
   <span style="background-color: #C0FFC0">var2  dw 4567h</span>
   <span style="background-color: #C0FFC0">var3  dw 0BABEh</span>
   :</pre>
<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Variable Limits and Negative Values</h3>
<p>How about the limits of those variable types then? See the table below:
<p>&nbsp;
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" width="50%" height="20">
    <tr>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center><b>Declaration</b></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center><b>dw</b></td>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center>define word</td>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center>2 bytes</td>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center>0-65535</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center><b>dd</b></td>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center>define double</td>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center>4 bytes</td>
      <td width="25%" height="20" align=center>0-4294967295</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>"Ah, I see that the <tt>db</tt>, <tt>dw</tt>, and <tt>dd</tt> are for
positive values only. How can I define a negative ones?" Well, you can
assign the variables as negative values, too. However, assembler will
convert them to the corresponding positive value. For example: If you
assign -1 to a <tt>db</tt> variable, assembler will convert them to
positive 255 integer. "How can it be? It will certainly confuse my
calculation then." Nope. In fact, the converted negative values will
behave similarly as if they are not flipped. Trust me. ;-) The only
thing you need to beware of is just when you want to print the
contents of that variable out to the screen and to distinguish
the negative values from the positive ones.
<p>To distinguish negatives from positives, usually programmers likes to
divide the variable ranges into two roughly equal parts. For bytes, if
the value is between 0 and 127, it is considered as positive, the rest
(128-255) are considered negative. This scheme also perpetuates in
dividing words and double-words. It's not hard at all, you just remember
which variables are considered negative and treat them accordingly.
You may find it cumbersome at first, though.
<p>Now, the next question would be on how can we find the corresponding
positive values for each negative numbers. Before we start, I just remind you
that 1 byte equals to 8 bits. So 2 bytes is 16 bits, 4 bytes is 32 bits.
I assume that you are able to convert a decimal number to binary and
vice versa. I also assume that you're capable in doing binary digit
addition.
<p>To find the corresponding positive value, you first ignore the negative
sign, then convert that number into binary. Remember the variable type you
are in. If it is a byte, the resulting binary number must be 8 digits. Likewise,
a word must be 16 digits and a double must be 32 digits. If the result digit is less
than that, pad it with zeroes. Then, flip all digits in the binary
number (i.e. from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). After that, increase that binary
by one. Convert the result back to decimal. Voila! That's the corresponding
positive value.
<p>For example, you want to convert -5 byte to its corresponding positive value.
Ignore the negative and convert 5 to binary. It's 101, right? Since
we're dealing with bytes, we must have 8 digits. The result 101 is just 3 digits,
so we must pad it with zeroes. Therefore, we now have 00000101. Then, we flip
the digits from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. So, we now have 11111010. The next step is
to increase that number by 1: 11111010 + 1 = 11111011. Then we convert this
number back to decimal: 251. Ta da! So, -5 is 251 in positive representation.
<p>Hmm, if you find that this calculation is cumbersome... uh... Well, you
have to live with that if you'd like to learn assembly. Moreover, you need
to be familiar with hexadecimal numbers too. You would need to learn some
converting operations and do some arithmetic between decimal, binary and
hexadecimal. If you're kinda awkward, you can always employ calculators.
If you do it over and over again, you probably do the calculations by
heart quickly (and amaze your friends ;-).
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Moving Around Values</h3>
<p>Still remember what registers are? Registers can be treated as
variables that reside in CPU chips, right? We have a handful of
those registers: AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, and so on. If you need
some review, <a href="../lowlevel.html">click here</a>.
<p>"If we have some registers built-in, why on earth do we need
another variables to declare then?" Hmm, there are a couple of
reasons. The first is that of course we need to have more variables
than just about twelve. The second is that some registers can't
be used for storing values at all, for example CS and IP, as they
are critical to running the program. That limits our freedom to
about 6 or 7 registers, which is not adequate for most of our needs.

<p>However, if you need to do some calculations or commands involving
the variables, in most occasion, you'll have to load the variable values
to the registers. Loading those values up to the registers and storing
the value from registers to variables can be done through the <tt>mov</tt>
command.

<p>The syntax of the <tt>mov</tt> command is <tt>mov a,b</tt> which
means assign <tt>b</tt> to <tt>a</tt> (i.e. <tt>a := b</tt>). So, in our
first program, we observe the command <tt>mov ax, 4c00h</tt>. That means
<tt>ax = 4c00h</tt>. We give the register AX value 4c00 hexadecimal. Note that
we <b>CAN'T</b> do <tt>mov 4c00h, ax</tt>. ;-)

<p>Similarly, you can load the variables to a register or store them back.
You can even transfer values between registers. Let's look at the example below:
<pre>    :
    :  ; (the usual preamble)
   jmp start

   our_var dw 10

start:
   <span style="background-color: #C0FFC0">mov bx, [our_var]</span>
   <span style="background-color: #FFFFC0">mov cx, bx</span>
   <span style="background-color: #C0FFF0">mov [our_var], cx</span>

   mov ax, 4c00h
   int 21h
end</pre>
<p>Ah. that's pretty straight forward. The first statement (i.e. <tt>mov bx, [our_var]</tt>)
is to load <tt>our_var</tt> variable to BX register. The second
statement (<tt>mov cx, bx</tt>) is to transfer that value from BX to CX.
The third statement (<tt>mov [our_var], cx</tt>) is to save the value from CX
register back to <tt>our_var</tt> variable. Note the square brackets when you
deal with variables. In MASM, those square brackets are not needed. However,
these square brackets are good to distinguish the variable from its address
so that in later on when we deal with pointers, we are not confused.

<p>When we deal with byte variables (i.e. <tt>db</tt>), we need to use
byte registers (e.g. AL, AH, BL, BH, and so on) to do our bidding.
AX, BX, CX, DX, and so on are word registers. How about moving around
double-word variables then? You can use double-word registers which is
available in 80386 processors or better (use <tt>p386n</tt> instead of <tt>p286n</tt>
to enable double-word registers). The double-word registers includes
EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, and so on. Or, you can have a work around, which
is discussed later (in caveats section). Better not to do 80386 instructions
first. I'll explain that in later chapters.

<p>We can later assign variables with constants with <tt>mov</tt> instruction.
However, <b>this will work only with 80286 or better</b> processors. In 8086,
this instruction is illegal. See below:
<pre>    :
   <span style="background-color: #FFFFC0">mov [word ptr our_var], 1</span>
    :</pre>
<p>Notice the <tt>word ptr</tt> modifier. Modifiers <b>must</b> be used when
you assign constants to variables. Why? It will be explained later.
You don't have to worry about this now. ;-) Since <tt>our_var</tt> is a word
variable, we need to use <tt>word ptr</tt> modifier. Likewise, byte variable
uses <tt>byte ptr</tt> modifier and double-word variable uses <tt>dword ptr</tt>.
Note that moving constants to dword ptr variables need to have a 80386 processors
or better (and use <tt>p386n</tt> instead of <tt>p286n</tt>).
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Caveats in MOVs</h3>
<p>There are caveats in using <tt>mov</tt> command. You <b>CANNOT</b> use
<tt>mov [var1], [var2]</tt>. In other words, <tt>mov</tt> command cannot
transfer values between two variables directly. So, how can we get around with
this? Use the register.
<p>Suppose both <tt>var1</tt> and <tt>var2</tt> are word variables. We can use
any word registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, and so on) to do the transfer. Suppose
we use AX. Thus, <tt>mov [var1], [var2]</tt> must be transformed into:
<pre>mov ax, [var2]
mov [var1],ax</pre>
<p>That's the way. Why do we do this? Well, don't ask me... ask the
maker of the assembler ;-). My guess is that we do not know the variable
types when that program is translated into machine codes. So, there is no
way for the processor to distinguish the variable types.
<p>The other is that variables in assembly <b>are treated differently</b>
than that of any high level programming language (Pascal, C/C++, Java, etc).
The assembler actually treat variables as a label that has an address in the memory
(RAM in most cases) associated to it. Moreover, the assembly language is later
assembled (or compiled) into a machine codes. Informations concerning variable
names and their respective types <b>are LOST</b>. Also, assembler <b>does not</b>
check the types of variables. It simply doesn't care. So, if you declare a
variable as bytes, but you use a word register to move them around, it's legal.
However, that particular <tt>mov</tt> will read and write 2 bytes instead of 1.
Likewise, using byte register to move a word variable will only transfer one byte
instead of two.
<p>This fact confuses a lot of people learning assembler, especially if they
have no low level view at all. However, <b>this is</b> the benefit of assembler.
You can tweak it around, use it or abuse it. ;-) See the example below:
<pre>    :
    :  ; (the usual preamble)
   jmp start

   var1 db 1
   var2 db 2
   var3 dw 305h

start:
   mov ax, [var1]  ; ax now equals to 0201h (i.e. 2*256+1)
   mov ax, [var3]  ; ax now equals to 0305h
   mov ax, [var2]  ; ax now equals to 0502h
   mov al, [var3]  ; al now equals to 05h
   :
   :</pre>
<p>OK, I know it's confusing. It becomes less murky when we deal with how the
assembler store those variables in the memory. Suppose <tt>var1</tt> get stored
in memory address 100h. Those variables placed adjacently will also be placed
adjacently in the memory. So, the memory diagram will look like this:
<p>&nbsp;
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" width="25%" height="20">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Address</b></td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Value</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>100h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>01h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>101h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>02h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>102h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>05h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>103h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>03h</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Clearly, address 100h contains <tt>var1</tt>. Address 101h contains
<tt>var2</tt>. Address 102h-103h contains <tt>var3</tt>. Notice
the way that Intel assembler store a word value. It stores the
least significant byte first, then the most significant byte later.
The value 305h is broken into two parts: 03h as the most significant
byte and 05h as the least significant byte. So, 05h get stored first,
then 03h. Note: Dealing with memories is better expressed by hexadecimals (or
hex for short). If you have a decimal number, you'd like to convert
the value to hex first. Each two digits of hex is worth one byte.

<p>Now, how can we deal with the <tt>mov</tt> then? OK, let's look into
this fragment of the code:
<pre>
   mov ax, [var1]  ; ax now equals to 0201h (i.e. 2*256+1)
   mov ax, [var3]  ; ax now equals to 0305h
   mov ax, [var2]  ; ax now equals to 0502h
   mov al, [var3]  ; al now equals to 05h</pre>
<p>Remember that AX is a word register and AL is a byte register and
one word equals to two bytes. The first instruction will read two bytes
from <tt>var1</tt>. So, it will read 01h and 02h altogether and
compose it to AX. The result is <b>0201h, not 0102h</b>. The second
instruction will read two bytes starting from <tt>var3</tt>. So, it will
read 05h and then 03h. The result is 0305h. Notice that the reading
is always swapped too. Likewise the third instruction. AX reads
two bytes from <tt>var2</tt> at address 101h: 02h first, then
05h next. The result is 0502h. The last one, AL reads only one
byte at the starting point of <tt>var3</tt> which gives us only 05h.
<p>That's the way the variables work.
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Oh, No! More Gotchas in MOVs</h3>
<p>You <b>NEED</b> to know this in order to understand the double-word
<tt>mov</tt> work around. So, this is important. ;-) Recall that
variables in assembly are treated as addresses. You can even
view it as pointers too. Suppose we have this example:

<pre>    :
    :  ; (the usual preamble)
   jmp start

   var1 db 1
   var2 db 2
   var3 dw 305h

start:
   <span style="background-color: #FFFFC0">mov ax, [var1+1]</span>
   :
   :</pre>
<p>Yes, it's similar to the one we use above. Note the new +1
thing. What does it mean? Recall the memory table displacement
from the previous section: <tt>var1</tt> has the address 100h.
So, <tt>mov ax, [var1+1]</tt> gives register AX 2 bytes from
address 101h (because 100h + 1 = 101h). Analoguously,
<tt>mov ax, [var1+2]</tt> is from address 102h and so on.
However, you cannot have the plus constant too high, like
<tt>mov ax, [var1+1000]</tt>. ;-) I guess the maximum is 8.
I'm not certain. Why don't you try it then?

<p>Now about the double-word work around. Double-word variables
are also stored similarly (i.e. bottom-up, flipped like the
word variables). Suppose we have this variable:
<pre>  my_var dd 1234BABEh</pre>
<p>Let's say that this variable get the address 100h. The memory
address mapping is as follows:
<p>&nbsp;
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" width="25%" height="20">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Address</b></td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Value</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>100h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>0BEh</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>101h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>0BAh</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>102h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>34h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>103h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>12h</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>See, it's similarly flipped up. In 80286 processor or below,
we are not able to use double-word registers to transfer values
to and from double-word variables. However, using the work around
I mentioned earlier, it is possible to do that. The way we usually
do it is as follows:
<pre>   mov ax, [my_var]
   mov dx, [my_var+2]</pre>
<p>Ah... Did you notice that? ;-) Now, the register pair DX:AX
contains the double-word value. Let's see how it works. Since
<tt>my_var</tt> has the address 100h, so AX get 2 bytes read
from there: 0BEh and 0BAh. Now AX has the value 0BABEh. Then
DX registers read 2 bytes from address 100h+2 (i.e. 102h). So,
34h and 12h are read. DX get the value 1234h. Therefore, pairing
DX:AX, get the original double-word value: 1234BABEh. Writing
to double-word variables are done similarly.
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Impacts on Registers</h3>
<p>Recall that the word register AX consists of AH and AL. Modifying
either AH or AL will modify the contents of AX. Likewise, modifying
AX will be likely modify AH and AL. This situation is analogous to
other word registers that have two byte registers (i.e. BX, CX, and DX).
Take look at this example:
<pre>   mov  ax, 1234h     ; AX = 1234h ==>  AH = 12h, AL = 34h
   mov  al, 56h     ; AX = 1256h ==>  AH = 12h, AL = 56h
   mov  ah, 99h     ; AX = 9956h ==>  AH = 99h, AL = 56h</pre>
<p>Ah. So, when I assign value to AX and AX is important to me,
I must not modify neither AL nor AH. That's true. Similar manner
occur on BX (with its BL and BH), CX (CL and CH), and DX (DL and DH).
To refresh your memory, please take a look at the picture below:
<p>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="regs.png" HEIGHT=355 WIDTH=314></CENTER>
<p>Please keep in mind this behavior when you do programs in assembly.
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Question Marks On Variables</h3>
<p>If you are not certain about the default value of a variable,
or you just lazy to specify one, you can give a question mark ("?")
instead. For example:
<pre>   another_var dw ?</pre>
<p>Well, this usually useful when you treat absolute memory address
to which is unsafe to determine the default value. Or may be
it is a requirement on combining assembly programs with other high
level programming languages (i.e. Pascal or C/C++).
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>[Not Exactly] String Variables</h3>
<p>You can define strings variables in assembly. It is as follows:
<pre>  message db "Hello World!$"</pre>
<p>String variables are required to be stored as <tt>db</tt> variables.
The string is then surrounded by quotes, either single or double, up
to you. If you begin a string with a double quote, you'll have to
close it with another double quote. If it is a single quote at start,
a single quote as well to finish. This is neat. So, if you plan to
use a quote in the middle of your string, you can enclose your string
by a double quote, and vice versa.
<p>Why do we have to end our string with a dollar sign ("$")? Well,
some of the ye olde DOS services require us to do so. However, some
of the system may require you to end it by zero ASCII code instead:
<pre>  message db "Hello World!",0</pre>
<p>How strange! Yes, we've got to live with these peculiarities. So,
before doing your string, make sure where your string will go. If it
is used to feed DOS (to print them), we have to end it with a dollar
sign ("$"). If we use new Windows or using C libraries, we have to
end it with zero ASCII code. I will tell you which one to use each
time. Don't worry. Eventhough you use Windows right now, most of
the times you'll still need to invoke the old DOS services. Windows
still provide those severely outdated thing to afford compatibility.
<p>How is the string variables are stores then? It is similar to
the normal variables except now, each characters of the string is
converted to its corresponding ASCII code. Uh oh, need to memorize
them. ;-) You can download any ASCII table program somewhere on
the net. There are plenty of resources.
<p>Another thing to remember in string variables is that the string
ASCII codes are <b>NOT flipped</b> as it usually is in normal variables.
So, suppose we have that <tt>message</tt> variable above stored at
address 100h. The memory contents is as follows:
<p>&nbsp;
<div align="center">

<p>Hmm... The string is stored contiguously.
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Multi-valued Variables</h3>
<p>"Hey, that's strange. You said that <tt>db</tt> variables
contain one byte." Well, I should say: Not exactly. The variables
defined as <tt>db</tt> means each value is defined as bytes.
However, there is no restriction on how many values we can
define for each variable names. ;-) See the example below:
<pre>   multivar db 12h, 34h, 56h, 78h, 00h, 11h, 22h, 00h</pre>
<P>That's a legal variable definition. The memory map is as follows
(assume that <tt>multivar</tt> is at address 100h):
<p>&nbsp;
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" width="25%" height="20">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Address</b></td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Value</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>100h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>012h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>101h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>034h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>102h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>56h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>103h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>78h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>104h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>00h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>105h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>11h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>106h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>22h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>107h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>00h</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Ah, so multi valued variables are stored contiguously. No flipping,
right? Hmm... not quite. Check this out:
<pre>   multivar2 dw 1234h, 5678h, 0011h, 2200h</pre>
<p>Its corresponding memory map (assume <tt>multivar2</tt> is at address 100h):
<p>&nbsp;
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" width="25%" height="20">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Address</b></td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center><b>Value</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>100h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>034h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>101h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>012h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>102h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>78h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>103h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>56h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>104h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>11h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>105h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>00h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>106h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>00h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>107h</td>
      <td width="50%" height="20" align=center>22h</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Hmm... the flipping is done word-wise. It's because
we declare the variable as define word (<tt>dw</tt>), so
the flipping is word-wise. Analoguously, declaring variables
as bytes (<tt>db</tt>) will not cause flipping since in
<tt>db</tt>, we don't do flipping. Also, declaring variables
as double-word (<tt>dd</tt>) will also be flipped double-word
wise (i.e. four bytes flipped at a time).
<p>Well, you can consider that multi-valued variable as
an array. In fact, high level programming language will
translate array definitions to this. Of course you can use
the plussed <tt>mov</tt> instructions to access the array.
However, it is not efficient. The proper way to access that
multi-valued array will be discussed later in this lesson.
Just stay tuned.
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Using dup</h3>
<p>Another way to declare a multi-valued variables are using
<tt>dup</tt> command. See the example below:
<pre>   my_array db 5 dup (00h)</pre>
<p>That example above is similar to:
<pre>   my_array db 00h, 00h, 00h, 00h, 00h</pre>
<p>Oh, so <tt>dup</tt> is kinda shortcut (or -- more precisely --
a macro) to define variables with the same values. Of course
you can define something like this:
<pre>   bar_array db 10 dup (?)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>I know this new variable concepts will overwhelm you for
a moment, but fret not. You'll get used to it. One suggestion
is to draw its memory table like I did for those examples.
This will clarify most situations. If you are in doubt, you're
always welcome to review through the preliminary chapter,
chapter 1 and 2.
<p>So far, I haven't even explained on a program that says
"Hello World!" All I did is to explain you the crucial
concepts on assembly language just to enable you to write
some basic assembly program. With these key concepts in mind,
you'll hopefully program in assembly more gracefully.
<p>OK, I think that's all for now. See you next time.
